## Build a DC Motor
 

We have been tasked with building a DC motor, testing it and then creating a better iteration. The initial design included one enameled coil of wire, copper tape as a commutator, a cork to function as a core and a suppport structure.
 
### The original motor:

The basic motor is simply one coil of wire wound around a cork with a copper tape commutator. This commutator has two segments protuding from the cork, one for negative and the other, positive. The ends of the coil of wire is stripped and soldered onto the segments so current can be conducted. 
The whole motor structure is supported by a basic frame with two magnets either side. The coil has 118 turns of copper.

This motor operates by touching positive and ground wires to the commutator- one on each side. This supplies a current to the wire. Since the wire is enameled except for the conducting ends, the current flows from one end to the other. Magnets on either side of the coil create a north-south field for the coil to pass through. We know form the principles of DC motor operation that a current-carrying wire inside a magnetic field will feel a magmnetic force. This force is given by F = iLB. Where i = current, L = wire length nad B = flux density. The result magnetic force on this coil will move it in a certain direction - this can be easily found using the right hand rule.
 


One of the issues we had with this motor was the small size, only allowing for one coil. Having only one coil will not give us the operation we would like to see from the motor. with only one coil moving through the magnetic field, there is current reversal in the wire only once per turn and so the motor cannot easily overcome the weight to turn. The motor needs more torque This is why this cork motor struggles to rotate and requires a push start. It was also difficult to wind the wire around such a small armature.

The commutator was fragile and crumpled too much to use effectively.

### Improving the design
 
Some of the major improvements to be made (without considering design changes):

 1. Increase the number of coils
 2. Create a more stable commutator
 3. A larger armature for the coils to wind around
 4. More magnets to create a stronger magnetic field. 


 
### First Iteration

We first decided to use 16 coils of wire, each with 100 turns. The commutator would have 32 segments to accomodate this. The wire is coiled around an airbed pump. Our intital idea was to have long but narrow loops from one edge of the shaft to the other. The commutator would comprise of 32 segments in a circle around the end of the shaft. Magnets are to be placed on a support structure wither side of the motor, and would be of a greater number than the original design.

In practice, this motor would not spin. The major problem is the coils of wire- by making them so narrow there would not be a large enough air gap between.

### Second Iteration
 
The design was changed to use 8 coils of wire, each with 100 turns. The commutator has 16 segments to accomodate this. The wire is coiled around an airbed pump.
